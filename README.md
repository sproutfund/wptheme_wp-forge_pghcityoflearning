pghcityoflearning.org WordPress Theme 2014-08
====================
This is a WordPress child theme developed for use with [WP-Forge] (http://themeawesome.com/responsive-wordpress-theme/) for http://pghcityoflearning.org in August 2014 on the [Sprout] (http://www.sproutfund.org) family of WordPress websites.

Please remember, this was a theme I hacked together in 2ish days when we abandoned the MODx-based City of Learning site. It certainly could be better documented but at least it shows how the site works. It relies on [WP-Forge 5.3.2] (https://github.com/tsquez/wp-forge/releases/tag/5.3.2) being installed as a parent theme.
